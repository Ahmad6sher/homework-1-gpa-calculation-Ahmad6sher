    ## About This Program
    This program calculates a GPA based on user-inputted letter grades. 
    The user is prompted to enter grades one by one until they decide to stop.
    
    ## Key Features:
    - Accepts grades in both uppercase and lowercase.
    - Handles invalid input by prompting the user again.
    - Displays the GPA formatted to three decimal places.
    - Provides a summary of the number of courses entered.
    
    ## Additional Improvements:
    - Predefined variables are used to improve readability.
    - A while loop ensures continuous input until the user decides to stop.
    - Edge case handling prevents division by zero errors when no grades are entered.
    - Enhanced error handling for non-letter inputs, ensuring robust input validation.
    - Clear output formatting and structured messages improve user experience.
    
    ## Common Issues & Fixes:
    - Users might enter incorrect inputs (e.g., numbers, symbols). This is handled by validating input against a set of valid grades.
    - Users might forget to enter any grades. The program notifies them that no GPA can be calculated if no valid grades are provided.
    - Initially, an issue arose where an empty input at the start caused a division by zero error. This was fixed by ensuring that at least one valid grade is required before calculating the GPA.
    - Some users accidentally included spaces or special characters when entering grades, which caused errors. The `.strip()` method ensures that spaces are removed before validation.
    - The program now provides clearer prompts and error messages to guide users effectively.
    - Added test case validation for automated testing to ensure program correctness.
